# Stocks Price Prediction

In this repo, I use a notebook to perform data analysis on 4 stocks in the Vietnamese stock market (FPT, MSN, PNJ, VIC). The methods tested are simple and evaluated based on three metrics: Sharpe ratio, final PNL, and MDD.

To run the notebooks, you need to set up the environment with the command:
```bash
cd stock_prediction/
bash setup_env.bash
```
